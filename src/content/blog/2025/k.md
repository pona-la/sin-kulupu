toki, ale o!

June is upon us, so let's catch up with cool stuff happening in the Toki Pona community in the past two weeks!

A lot of interesting news this time around:

* We have launched [lipu.pona.la](https://lipu.pona.la), a Toki Pona library! It includes prose, poetry, songs, blogposts, -- anything we've been able to gather over the past year. Look around, start reading, find something you like, or [add more](https://lipu.pona.la/add) to it!
* jan Tamalu announced the results of the [2024 Toki Pona demographic survey](https://tokiponacensus.github.io/results2024/), which was taken by ~2000 people! The next survey will open in August, on [suno pi toki pona](https://suno.pona.la/2025/).
* The folks behind [lipu tenpo](https://liputenpo.org/), a Toki Pona magazine, [want to know](https://forms.gle/DdxxtHMSztaS1dqNA) what projects the community wants to see get additional support and funding!
* jan Sonja consulted the community on proper names for languages and countries via a [survey](https://forms.gle/pgqYsMaDWFNPYrMU7), which is now closed.
* jan Netakin and jan Tekinowi are planning a [Toki Pona game jam](https://itch.io/jam/mu), which will be open from June 25 to July 1!

Over on Youtube, we've got some fun new original content:

* jan Lakuse and jan Tepo [go to Costco](https://youtu.be/0PL5n-HVVfE) and talk about its business model and cult-like appeal.
* mun Kekan San streamed playing through chapter 1 of [Deltarune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTBx1aHtAfI), with more chapters to be played later!
* jan Janeko is making a series of [videos about Toki Pona in Polish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbdaDeeOcrQ).

As we have come to expect, more translations of songs:

* mossby translated [Over the Garden Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ-CDM0AFM4)!
* akesi sike Butte translated [Shiny is the View](https://seka.pona.la/w/tnPyiTC7WvemShC2zRXU9Z) by Cosmo Sheldrake!
* jan Pikesike translated [Man on a Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IHkp_p7mX4) by The Defended and [Shika-bu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkhpfoOz9Wk)
* jan Saki translated [Viva la Vida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai83GIwMOT8)!
* jan Janpa Onjon translated [Memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwb6L-pmfsI) by Maroon 5!

Songs are cool, but this time folks have also translated lots of other stuff, like games, comics, clips:

* jan Pawasi translated [Cotton 100%](https://gitlab.com/ma-Meluken/musi-Koton-100/-/releases/permalink/latest), a SNES game!
* u/Snargleplax is translating [The Last Starship](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/1kzcueq/musi_the_last_starship_tan_kulupu_introversion/), a game by the developers of Prison Architect!
* jan Jasi dubbed a clip from [Yoksul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfn_g0rmXUc), a Turkish movie!
* kasi Lija is translating a comic [akesi Luli](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/1kxma46/akesi_luli_chapter_1_again/)!

And, of course, some weekly events you can take part in:

* As usual, the VRChat community holds its [weekend meetups](https://bsky.app/profile/tokiponavr.bsky.social), which you are welcome to join!
* jan Lakuse hosts luka pona lessons in [kama sona](https://discord.gg/ChC6qtVsSE) every Sunday!
