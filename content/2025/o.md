toki, ale o!

This August we celebrated **suno pi toki pona** -- Toki Pona Day! It consisted of ~39 panels spanning 24 hours of livestreaming, so let's talk about everything that took place!

The celebration opened with [me, kala Asi](https://youtu.be/1J54Qq58Y20), summarising all the big community news of the past year and what the viewers could expect from the rest of the event.

**We had wonderful musicians performing live:**

The celebration concluded, but there are still things you can help with! Tell kulupu Linku about [what words](https://linku.la/wile) and [what glyphs](https://linku.la/wile-glyphs) you use. This is a yearly survey that helps us keep the dictionary up to date. The forms close around the 9th September.

As for things that have happened outside the celebration, we will cover them next time!
