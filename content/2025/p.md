toki, ale o!

*suno pi toki pona* is well and truly finished, and it's time to return to our regularly(-ish) scheduled coverage. Let's catch up on a whole month of cool things that have happened in the Toki Pona community!

**Our longstanding community projects continue to bear fruit:**
* The *lipu tenpo* magazine has released its August issue -- [nanpa pilin](https://liputenpo.org/lipu/nanpa-pilin/)! Read about early human migration, Laozi's teachings, video game development, and more!
* The *kalama sin* podcast released a [new episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTHQdK3VtkI), in which kon Okisen tells jan Tepo about the science fiction of Derin Edala!
* The [yearly Linku survey](https://linku.la/wile) is still open. It gathers data on which toki pona words the community reports to use. This year, there is also a similar [survey about sitelen pona usage](https://linku.la/wile-glyphs). The survey closes in just a few days, on September 9th.

**Learning Toki Pona is becoming more accessible:**

This edition of *sin kulupu* has been put together with lots of help from kon Okisen, jan Ke Tami, jan Lakuse, jan Lapi and others. I have been feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work that it takes to keep this newsletter up to date, and the help they offered makes a huge difference. If fate so decrees, the next issue might be less terribly lengthy!  
o awen pona.
