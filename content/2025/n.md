toki, ale o!

Let's catch up with this past month in the Toki Pona community! I try to post a newsletter every two weeks, but I've had a lot on my plate, because...
* [suno pi toki pona](https://suno.pona.la/2025/), the yearly Toki Pona celebration, is going live *this weekend*! The 24-hour [schedule](https://suno.pona.la/2025/tenpo/) is jam-packed with informative talks, creative works, game time, and live music! Come along and watch the stream on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@maponapitokipona), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/maponapitokipona), or [Discord](https://discord.gg/6zkugJFU4x)!

**This month has been good for the written word:**
* The yearly [writing contest](https://utala.pona.la/index_en.html) is wrapping up with 31 short and 21 long-form stories! [Vote](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIfL0OgZ6lLHDv4sabXXYdQg3Lmln8Qg0saygi0d3aJtHUvA/viewform) for your favourite submissions!
* Surprise! jan Sonja released su #2. This book unites prominent voices in Toki Pona, Esperanto, Guosa, and other languages. How do our communities envision our shared destiny to thrive together under the same sun? Where do you agree or disagree on solidarity, equality, and collaboration? o su a! Explore the [free PDF](http://sunosama.org/0702S_EPROOF_gut_interior_sunosama_20250707d_p8change_rmvA_BLEED_.pdf). What's **your** personal message, art, or interpretation of #sunosama? You create the future. How do you imagine conlang speakers in 2037 will look back on this growing question?
* Following up from the [parallel translation of Siddartha](https://www.lulu.com/shop/hermann-hesse-and-jeff-moe-and-semyon-chaichenets-and-stefan-langer/siddhartha-jan-sitata/paperback/product-zmyrdpe.html) mentioned last time, jan Tene released a translation of Strange Tales by Lovecraft in book form!

**Tokiponists continue to arrange irl meetups:**
* Over 40 Toki Pona speakers met up in Strasbourg this week. The next Europe meetup is scheduled to be in August 2026 in Spain -- in time for the total solar eclipse!
