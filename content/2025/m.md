toki, ale o!

Now is the first half of July, and once again it is time to check what's been happening in the Toki Pona community these past two weeks! More like three weeks, I've been slacking.

**First of all, two large creative collaborations:**
* lipu tenpo has released its June issue -- [nanpa supa](https://liputenpo.org/lipu/nanpa-supa/)! Read about Ikea, the game Battleship, the Khasi people, enneagrams, and more!
* The Toki Pona game jam has closed with [34 submissions](https://itch.io/jam/mu/entries)! Play them now!

**Some awesome stuff is coming up soon:**
* The annual Toki Pona [writing contest](https://utala.pona.la/) closes soon, on July 15!
* The annual Toki Pona meetup in Europe is coming up next month! It will be held in Strasbourg on 1-4th August. [Sign up](https://forms.gle/KBKmtW791g4WgV4x9) if you want to come! Detailed information available [in a ma pona thread](https://discord.com/channels/301377942062366741/1390330928261370000).
* 1 month remains until [suno pi toki pona](https://suno.pona.la/2025/), a 24-hour festival of Toki Pona culture, taking place on Discord and Youtube every August. This is a good time to [sign up as a presenter](https://suno.pona.la/wile/)!
