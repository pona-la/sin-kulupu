toki, ale o! Welcome to new subscribers: there are now more than 320 of us!

April is upon us! Here's how the communities celebrated the silly times of April Fools:

* [lipu tenpo](https://liputenpo.org/) has released its annual April Fools zine, this time themed as lipu tenpo [nanpa kokosila](https://liputenpo.org/lipu/nanpa-kokosila/)! Instead of the usual toki pona, it features various other conlangs, including kay(f)bop(t), tuki tiki, Lojban, Uwulang, Klingon, and of course Esperanto.
* [ma pona](https://discord.gg/6zkugJFU4x) added an ilo owe which censored many beloved words such as s\*weli, t\*ki, and u\*pa.
* [kama sona](https://discord.gg/ChC6qtVsSE) added a channel for answering learner questions incorrectly! (Now archived; you can read it using the archive role.)
* lipamanka's [semantic spaces dictionary](https://lipamanka.gay/essays/dictionary) now includes kijetesantakalu, which was coined for April Fools 16 years ago!
* Having [pilin tonsi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAtu-z-9CT4) is a rollercoaster of euphoria and dysphoria, but have you tried... [pipi tonsi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zNtC9kE1kc)?

This fortnight, Toki Pona has been in the spotlight in several non-Toki Pona-focused communities:

* jan Sonali (Shonalika) [talked about the meaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBNAumF3o_E) behind their song ["pali pini"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S81bNIK4MaE) and their story of learning Toki Pona.
* jan Wiwijan (Vivian Wilson) [talked a bit about Toki Pona](https://youtu.be/Gi0qyDmINJs?t=1548) in a stream / interview with Hasan Abi.
* jan Kipin (Sapaa) a short documentary about the [Chicago suburb of Oak Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lahXFk8mBwc), also serving as an intro to Toki Pona!
* ilo Tani's talk for the Conlang Adventures conference can now be [watched as a vod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZLMwi144Jg)!

Toki Pona folks continue making translations and original content:

* During Tenpo Pana, we got to watch [a dub of BFDIA 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAkbemmXiuo) by meli Siliwa! (The next Tenpo Pana is expected on April 27th.)
* We got several translations of Vocaloid / UTAU songs: ["Brain Implosion Energy"](https://youtu.be/x7fiiTg3Mjc), ["Magical Cure! Love Shot!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbxxeyRTtEA),["Goodbye"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxhYY6pbx3A), ["Heya ni Terasareta Hikari"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Qq3UdaD9mI), and ["Miku"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4mYVQIr6MM)!

* akesi wakon made [an animated short about a soweli](https://youtu.be/KWFyg_I2AXY), narrated by mun Kekan San!
