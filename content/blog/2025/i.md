toki, ale o!

As May dawns upon us, let's go over what we have seen in the Toki Pona community in the past two weeks!

* I (kala Asi) made a new Toki Pona course, [Wasona](https://wasona.com)! It is similar to [lipu sona pona](https://lipu-sona.pona.la/), but also includes sitelen pona, audio, sentence practice in the style of Duolingo, and more!
* Minecraft [now supports](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w18a) Sitelen Pona, via Unifont and UCSUR!
* jan Kipin (Sapaa) [navigated the city](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9TXBIxxKVw) of Milwaukee using only Toki Pona, with instructions by jan Kesi!
* jan Sami is writing [toki pona Knight](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/1k5y2xu/toki_pona_knight_chapter_1_the_basics/), an illustrated introduction to Toki Pona, to assist people with learning disabilities.

Some news about community events:

* ma pona concluded its icon/banner contest!
* We're studying [how people write sitelen pona](https://forms.gle/2nj1KVmUEPFPL9Lo6)! The poll is open until May 11th.
* Tenpo Pana is looking to keep things fresh with new fun activities like Powerpoint Karaoke. The monthly event was held on [ma pona](https://discord.gg/6zkugJFU4x) on April 27th, and the next Tenpo Pana is expected on May 25th.

As always, new original and translated songs:
