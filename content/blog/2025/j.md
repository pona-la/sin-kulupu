toki, ale o!

We're in the second half of May, so let's get up to speed with what the community has been up to for the past two weeks! (Posting a couple days late, sorry!)

In more general, community news:

* The yearly [writing contest](https://utala.pona.la/tenpo-ni_en) is open once again! Until July 15, you can submit your work to be anonymously rated. Results will be announced on suno pi toki pona.
* Speaking of which, you can now [rewatch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjOmpMyMxd8SrubgbRcfuUxOpmToxq5Go) last year's Toki Pona Day. This year's event is coming up in 3 months -- you can [learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnmOklcxVnk) about it or [join](https://suno.pona.la/wile) as a performer.
