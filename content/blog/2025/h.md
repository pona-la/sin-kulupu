toki, ale o! We're in the second half of April!  
This newsletter now has a [permanent home page](https://sin-kulupu.pona.la/) and RSS feed!

Some community-wide news:

* suno pi toki pona, [our yearly celebration and 24-hour livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnmOklcxVnk), is in roughly 4 months! You can now sign up to join it as a performer or helper.
* jan Sonja has announced the [Sitelen Pona Publishers and Typographers Association](https://sitelenpona.org/). Its purpose is to collaborate with Unicode and UCSUR on standardised representation of sitelen pona.
* [ma pona](https://discord.gg/6zkugJFU4x) wrapped up submissions for its art contest and has opened a [voting form](https://forms.gle/SajH5tHHAV7D5qZ56). The vote closes on April 23rd, which is very soon!

Toki Pona folks continue making original content:

* jan Usawi made a new original song, ["mi lon tomo"](https://youtu.be/t71JhELi9eM)!
* aks Ejan made a new [artistic sitelen pona font](https://github.com/Mrpalland/nasin-palisa)! (aks Ejan is also a producer for the recently released "[ENA: Dream BBQ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2134320/ENA_Dream_BBQ/)", and jan Tepo appears in the game credits! We'll wait and see what that means.)
* jan Ke Tami has made three videos recently! Both for [tokiponists interested in German](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc7R2x5fn6ArcUFtsk7a0EQKZ8314JRoL) and [Germans interested in Toki Pona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eorItWrB098).
* jan Ali wrote a [short poem about supernovas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGmyhLHx4iI)!
* ko Apo made a [short skit about tomo tawa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KJ9MNhe0-Y)!

And more translations are with us as always:

* tonsi tenpi translated the song ["Phantom Island"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK4nhX_e53w)!
* I (kala Asi) celebrated 4/13 by translating the song ["Leviathan the Girl"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wSN2duQmxk)!
* Another Sonic song translation from akesi Kilo -- [You Can Do Anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avSaSdRnHhU)!
* Several more songs have been translated and performed with Vocaloids / UTAU: ["Mischievous Function"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f76NrpVeM9U), ["Daily Heaven and Hell"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__ytyiZe5Bk), and ["Igaku"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Osm17Dfcw).
* jan Mosutu translated a [French get-rich-quick skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzUbF62rkC4)! Seems like the original is a real German ad, but it was poorly translated into French, which turned it into a bit of a meme.

And, of course, some weekly events you can take part in:

* As usual, the VRChat community holds its [weekend meetups](https://bsky.app/profile/tokiponavr.bsky.social/post/3llmrn2t6y22x), which you are welcome to join!
* jan Lakuse hosts luka pona lessons in [kama sona](https://discord.gg/ChC6qtVsSE) every Sunday!
* jan Ke Tami hosts a weekly voice chat meetup for jan Eta's [lipu tenpo reading group](https://discord.com/channels/969386329513295872/1356386599268520006). Both beginners and proficient speakers are welcome!
* The next Tenpo Pana presentation / hangout is on April 27th on [ma pona](https://discord.gg/6zkugJFU4x), come join!
